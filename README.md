# TwitterStreamEventBot
Get real time information on what's exciting at the Olympics! If you're interested in a topic, tell the bot you want to follow that topic and the bot will ping you if anything exciting is happening related to that topic. You can also ask the bot what the trending topics are right now to see a list of keywords people are using on Twitter.

To run this bot, you’re going to need Twitter Access tokens, an Azure account, a cognitive services instance, and a LUIS account.
